# Advent of Code 2023 -- Python solutions
This is my first AOC year. I'm posting my solutions to get feedback or help someone to understand how it's done. Nothing really fancy or smart can be found in those solutions, I reckon. 

Be warned, starting from about day 7 or 8, I will switch to .NET C#, as it is more suitable for larger projects requiring classes, instances, etc. Python is good for completing first couple of days easily, then gets progressively worse and clunkier.
